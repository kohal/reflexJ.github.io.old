### AbstractQueuedSynchronizer 同步队列器的源码及应用

#### AQS 的doAcquire

* 线程独占式获取
``` java

     /**
     * Acquires in exclusive mode, ignoring interrupts.  Implemented
     * by invoking at least once {@link #tryAcquire},
     * returning on success.  Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly
     * repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking {@link
     * #tryAcquire} until success.  This method can be used
     * to implement method {@link Lock#lock}.
     *
     * @param arg the acquire argument.  This value is conveyed to
     *        {@link #tryAcquire} but is otherwise uninterpreted and
     *        can represent anything you like.
     */

    }

      /**
     * Acquires in exclusive uninterruptible mode for thread already in
     * queue. Used by condition wait methods as well as acquire.
     *
     * @param node the node
     * @param arg the acquire argument
     * @return {@code true} if interrupted while waiting

* 队列的像素图
``` java
  * <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
     * tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
     * <pre>
     *      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
     * head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
     *      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
     * </pre>
